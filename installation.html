<pre>
1. Download optifine for your version by going to optifine.net, clicking Downloads, and downloading optifine
2. AT THE TIME OF WRITING THIS, optifine for 1.15.2 is still in beta release, install that by clicking preview versions.
3. Run the jar file.
4. Select the optifine profile, and run minecraft
5. Click on the green install button above depending on your version of minecraft
6. Move the downloaded file to the required location. This location contains all the Minecraft texture packs:
	Windows XP and above: %appdata%\.minecraft\texturepacks
	GNU/Linux: ~/.minecraft/texturepacks (this folder may be hidden in the Home folder).
	macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/texturepacks (this folder may be hidden).
	If the above does not work, try replacing texturepacks with resourcepacks in the file location
7. Run Minecraft (1.14 or 1.15 depending on which version of the pack you installed).
8. Click Texture Packs in Options. Click Open Texture Pack Folder, and select the file that was downloaded.
9. In a few seconds the texture pack appears in Minecraft. Select it and click "Done". The texture pack is now applied.
   If Minecraft did not update, simply exit and reopen the texture packs screen.
10. Make sure custom items, and custom skies are enabled for the best experience! :)
